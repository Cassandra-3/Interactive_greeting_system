Description:
This project includes two systems, each at different entrances for anyone visiting Fleming College. The system will detect the user, initiate the display to greet them, assist with their queries, and guide them to their destination. Facial recognition is implemented for the user and is optional while registration can be completed using credentials. Once you have chosen either voice or text input you can enter the question in the search engine. The system will then display a list of possible locations for them to choose from. Once a destination is chosen, the direction to the location is displayed using a map of the college. The user can continue navigating after exiting the system using their device.

This consists of Flask application along with python modules, HTML and jinja templates that were created for the project.
